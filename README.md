# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Deer403 and I'm a front-end developer based in China/ShenZhen.
Although I'm currently a front-end developer, my personal goal is to become a skilled full-stack web engineer. In my free time, I'm learning Go and exploring other back-end technologies to complement my front-end skills.

## About Me

I'm passionate about building responsive and visually appealing web applications using the latest technologies in the front-end space. My skills include:

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- React.js and Vue.js
- Bootstrap, Material UI, and Tailwind CSS

I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to enhance my skills as a front-end developer.

## My GitHub Projects

There are currently no outstanding projects, and I am working hard

## Contact Me

Feel free to reach out to me via email at bakametro@gmail.com.

I'm always open to collaboration opportunities and discussing new ideas. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ™Œ
